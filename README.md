# Accessible Tabs Code Challenge

Accessible Tabs Code Challenge: Create tab groups fully compliant with the WAI ARIA specification.

Web URL: [front-end-coding-test.web.app](https://front-end-coding-test.web.app)

This application includes:

- A set of tab group components fully compliant with the WAI ARIA specification
- The tab lists are fully operational and tested in Chrome, Firefox, Safari and Edge
- Home page lists examples of tab groups:

  - Tabs with "Automatic Activation" and handle multiple tab groups rendered on a single page
  - Directly link to any given tab on a page, retain active tab state with back/forward browser navigation and refresh

- Online resources used to complete the code challenge
  - [W3 WAI-ARIA Practices](https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria-practices-1.1/#tabpanel)
  - [ARIA: tab role](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Roles/Tab_Role)

Install

| `yarn`

##### \* Prettier is not included as part of the eslint setup. Please enable it via VS Code's plugins section and tick the "Format On Save" option.

### Available Scripts:

Run the app in the development mode ([http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)):

| `yarn start`

Launch the test runner in the interactive watch mode:

| `yarn test`

Run linter:

| `yarn lint`

Build the app for production to the `build` folder:

| `yarn build`

##### \* The package will include the app config.

Deploy the `build` directory's content to Firebase:

| `yarn deploy`

##### \* Make sure you install the latest firebase-tools, sign in to Google and run `firebase use [project-id]`.

## Description

I focused on writing simple and clean front-end code to demonstrate understanding of task requirements and design patterns. By adding TypeScript and restricted linting (including no-explicit-any), I wanted to demonstrate my experience to produce clean, reliable and well-structured code in a reasonably short amount of time.

Main patterns followed in my project:

- Atomic design
- Smart containers and simple components

Here is the list of [all activities on Git branches](https://github.com/alanrad/accessible-tabs-code-challenge/branches/yours).

> I didn't squash-merge or rebase-merge PRs to make it easy to read and understand my work progress.

### A few things to note

1. Added and configured linter tools and pre-commit hooks to produce reliable code and well-structured git commits (I follow AngulaJS commit message convention).
2. Added Firebase deployment for quick hosting and release solution.
3. I made the configuration app swappable to be able to deploy the same package to different dev environments.

### Outstanding work

1. Appropriate unit and/or integration tests will be included soon.
